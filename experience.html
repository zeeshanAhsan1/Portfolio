              <li>Python Full-Stack Development for Data Annotation (ADAS) – Developed custom web-based tools using Python (FastAPI) and JavaScript (React) for annotating and analyzing vehicle trajectory data. These tools allowed for the seamless viewing and editing of labeled log data, with features to overlay real-time sensor data on the trajectory path, enabling precise analysis of how sensor inputs affected vehicle decisions. Enabled data annotation and ‘ground truth’ labelling through both human and machine-generated labels.</li>
              <li>Automated Testing and Validation Dashboard (ADAS) – Created a dashboard to automate the testing of path planning algorithms against a suite of predefined test cases. The dashboard facilitated simulations, captured results, and presented key performance metrics (e.g., time taken to park, distance traveled, path smoothness). Integrated automated notifications to the corresponding stakeholder/teams to quickly address any issues introduced by code changes and failure of test cases.</li>
              <li>Collaboration and Integration – Worked closely with cross-functional teams, including UI/UX designers and data scientists, to build reusable components and integrate backend services. Facilitated seamless data flow and interaction between components, iterated quickly in an agile environment and handled integration challenges for building reliable and scalable data pipelines for machine learning development.
